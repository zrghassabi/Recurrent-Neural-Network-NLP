# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Natural Language Processing

sources

-Use torch text from https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html  

-use repository from https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis  and open simple sentiment analysis in google colab

-In pytorch website, go to Doc section, in search box , type rnn, you will see RNN-cell, LSTM cel, GRU cell,etc. The way, you need define RNN and each cell were described.
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html?highlight=rnn#torch.nn.RNN

-In all recurrent NN, you work with a sequence (e.x. a sentence of words). Each word is a vector of size n. You will have input and hidden state and output in each RNN.Each layer input
