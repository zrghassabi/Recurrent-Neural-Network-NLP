# Recurrent-Neural-Network-NLP

In pytorch website, go to Doc section, in search box , type rnn, you will see RNN-cell, LSTM cel, GRU cell,etc. The way, you need define RNN and each cell were described.

In all recurrent NN, you work with a sequence (e.x. a sentence of words). Each word is a vector of size n. 


You will have input and hidden state and output in each RNN.Each layer input
